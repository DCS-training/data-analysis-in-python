    "# Introduction to data analysis in Python: Week 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we're going to be using the [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) dataset. This dataset contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The data was collected from 2007-2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Species:** The dataset includes three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo. Each species has distinct physical characteristics and behaviors.\n",
    "2. **Island:** Penguins in the dataset were observed on three different islands: Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. These islands are part of the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.\n",
    "3. **Bill Length (mm):** Length of a penguin's bill in millimeters. Bill length can vary significantly between species and is an important characteristic for identifying species.\n",
    "4. **Bill Depth (mm):** Depth of a penguin's bill in millimeters. Bill depth, like bill length, is an important characteristic for species identification.\n",
    "5. **Flipper Length (mm):** Length of a penguin's flipper in millimeters. Flipper length is related to a penguin's swimming ability and varies between species.\n",
    "6. **Body Mass (g):** Body mass of a penguin in grams. Body mass can provide insights into the health and nutrition of the penguins.\n",
    "7. **Sex:** Male or female.\n",
    "8. **Year:** The year when the observation was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting set up\n",
    "\n",
    "As with last week, the first thing we need to do is import the packages we'll be using and then read in our dataset. This week, since we're moving on to data visualisation, we'll also need to load a couple of additional packages: ``seaborn`` is a wrapper on ``matplotlib`` which makes it easy to work with pandas dataframes, but we still need to import matplotlib to get access to some basic functions."
