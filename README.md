# Introduction to data analysis in Python

**Last updated**: November 2024

**Author**: Aislinn Keogh

## Welcome

This two-class course will introduce you to working with structured (tabular) data in Python. We will cover the basics of: 

- importing datasets 
- data cleaning, including dealing with missing or incorrectly-formatted values 
- data wrangling 
- extracting summary statistics 
- data visualisation 

By the end of this course, you will be familiar with two key Python libraries used for data analysis: ``pandas`` (for working with dataframes), and ``matplotlib`` (for data visualisation). 

We will work together on a sample dataset, but you are also welcome to bring your own. 

This is an intermediate-level course. We will assume that you are already familiar with the basics of Python, including variables, loops, functions, and basic data types like lists and dictionaries. No prior knowledge of any external libraries is assumed.

## How to use these materials

Throughout this course we will be using the [Noteable](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/) platform to run Jupyter notebooks. This is a cloud-based computational notebook system that work on your browser from any device.

### Start Noteable
1.  Open the following link in a new tab:  [https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login](https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login).
2.  Login with your EASE credentials.
3.  Under 'Standard Notebook (Python 3)' click 'Start'
   
### Download the files to Noteable.
1.  From the Noteable home page, click on the '+GitRepo' button at the top right of the screen.
2.  In the 'Git Repository URL' field copy the link to this GitHub repository, "https://github.com/DCS-training/data-analysis-in-python". Ignore all other fields.
3.  Once filled in, click the 'clone' button. After a few moments, you will then see a new folder appear with the files.
